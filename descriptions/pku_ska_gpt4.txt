In the "Bow" action sequence, the human skeleton initiates motion with the hip joints hinging to tilt the torso forward, while the knees slightly flex to stabilize the position. Concurrently, the spinal joints articulate, ensuring the back remains straight as the upper body leans forward. The shoulder joints marginally rotate to align the arms parallel along the body, with elbows slightly flexed and wrists in a neutral position. As the deepest part of the bow is reached, there's brief maintenance of this full flexed hip position before the joints extend back to an upright stance, reversing the initial movements smoothly.
In the "Brushing Hair" action sequence, the dominant arm primarily exhibits repetitive, vertical elbow flexion and extension. The shoulder of the same arm alternates between slight abduction and adduction, maintaining a raised position throughout. Concurrently, the wrist engages in mild flexion to maintain a constant angle relative to the forearm, enhancing the uniformity of the motion. The non-dominant arm generally remains stationary, with minimal movements to possibly stabilize the body posture or adjust the dominant arm's trajectory. The lower body exhibits minimal displacement, maintaining a static posture that supports the upper body's concentrated activity. This cyclical movement pattern persists for the duration of the hair brushing action.
In the "Brushing teeth" action sequence, the primary motion involves the dominant arm, where the shoulder joint serves as the principal pivot. The elbow joint typically exhibits a repetitive flexing and extending motion, maintaining a roughly 90-degree angle. The wrist joint of the same arm slightly rotates back and forth, enhancing the primary motion initiated by the elbow. Throughout the sequence, the non-dominant arm remains relatively stable, occasionally moving slightly to adjust the standing posture. The spine shows minimal flexion, primarily maintaining an upright orientation, while the lower limbs sustain a stable position with slight shifts in weight from one leg to another to ensure balance.
In the action sequence "Check time (from watch)," the primary movement involves the wrist and elbow of one arm. Initially, the elbow flexes while the corresponding wrist supinates, bringing the forearm from a downward hanging position to a horizontal orientation in front of the torso. The other arm remains relatively stable, with slight adjustments for balance. These joint movements position the wrist and hand at a comfortable viewing angle. After a brief pause, the wrist pronates as the elbow extends, reverting the arm back to the initial resting position alongside the body. This completes the sequence with minimal involvement from other body joints.
In the "Cheer up" action sequence, the human subject initiates movement with shoulder abduction, raising both arms laterally until overhead. Simultaneously, the elbows remain extended throughout the lift. Following this, wrist joints flex as the arms are vigorously waved side to side, primarily driven by rotation at the shoulders. Mid-sequence, the hip joints display slight flexion and extension alternately, suggesting a subtle jumping or bouncing motion, with knees flexing minimally to absorb the impact. The sequence concludes with the arms descending in a controlled manner, shoulders adducting to lower the arms, and elbows flexing slightly as the hands approach the lateral torso.
In the "Clapping" action sequence, the human skeletal motion primarily involves the arms. Initially, the elbows are flexed, with wrists slightly flexed and hands positioned at about chest level. As the sequence progresses, the arms dynamically move: the shoulder joints rotate, pushing the forearms outward and slightly upward, meanwhile, the wrists extend to bring the palms back toward each other. Once the hands are aligned face-to-face, the forearms then move inward due to adduction at the shoulders, resulting in the hands meeting with the palms touching. This motion cycle repeats, generating a rhythmic pattern as the action of clapping continues.
In the action sequence labeled "Cross hands in front (say stop)," the skeletal motion begins with the shoulders slightly rotated forward, leading to the abduction of both arms at the shoulder joints, lifting laterally. As the arms ascend, the elbows remain extended, allowing the forearms to move horizontally across the body. Both wrists flex as the hands approach each other, ultimately overlapping around the centerline of the torso. This movement concludes with the palms facing outward and the fingers extended, creating a barred gesture directly in front of the upper chest. The entire sequence occurs fluidly, emphasizing a defensive or stopping posture.
In the "Drink water" action sequence, the skeletal motion begins with the subject’s dominant arm, initially resting along the body, flexing at the elbow and shoulder in a smooth upward and forward trajectory. Meanwhile, the wrist joint flexes to assist in a hand motion that resembles a grasping gesture. As the elbow continues to flex, bringing the hand closer to the head, the shoulder joint adjusts slightly to accommodate this movement, aligning the hand in front of the face area. Once the hand reaches its zenith, there is a brief stabilization phase where the elbow and shoulder joints hold position momentarily. Following this, the arm sequentially extends at the elbow and shoulder, returning to the initial resting position along the side of the body. Concurrently, the torso maintains an upright position with minimal movement, ensuring balance and stability during the arm and hand motion.
In the "Drop" action sequence, the individual begins with a stable, upright posture: knees and elbows slightly bent. As the action commences, the person’s center of gravity shifts downward swiftly due to simultaneous flexion at the knees and hips, alongside a mild bending of the elbows to balance and provide support. This descent is often abrupt, with shoulders and hips lowering in parallel, which drives the spine to bow lightly forward. Near the lowest phase, the action typically stabilizes momentarily before the individual pushes off, mostly through the knee joints extending, consequentially elevating the hips and shoulders back to a standing position to complete the sequence.
In the "Eat meal/snack" action sequence, the primary skeletal movement is observed in the wrists, elbows, and shoulders. Initially, the shoulder joints stabilize while the elbows flex and the wrists articulate to elevate the hands towards the head, creating narrow angles. This cycle of flexion and extension repeats rhythmically as the hands repeatedly move from an intermediate position near the torso, ascending towards the head, and then descending back to the initial position. Throughout the sequence, minimal but synchronized torso adjustments aid in balancing and coordinating the upper limbs' movements, ensuring fluid motion. The movement is repetitive and generally maintains the upper body's frontal plane alignment.
In the "Falling" action sequence, the human skeleton exhibits a distinct downward and forward motion pattern. Initially, the hip joints flex, bringing the torso closer to the knees, while the knee joints flex, and the ankle joints maintain stability momentarily. The elbows may flex reflexively, positioning the arms in front of the body as a protective reaction. As the sequence progresses, the hip joints rotate backward due to the loss of balance, while the center of gravity lowers and shifts forward. Eventually, the skeletal posture collapses towards the ground, with a final increase in the flexion of hip and knee joints, and the wrists and elbows absorb the impact as the arms are extended forward or positioned to cushion the fall. The skeletal alignment becomes horizontal or nearly horizontal relative to the ground.
In the skeletal motion sequence of "Giving something to another person," the human figure initiates the action by raising an arm, typically the right, bending at the elbow joint so that the forearm is lifted to a horizontal position in front of the torso. The opposite arm remains relatively stationary, providing balance. The shoulder joint of the active arm articulates, moving slightly forward, and then stabilizing as the hand reaches its endpoint. Concurrently, there may be a slight rotation in the torso and a subtle shift in the hip joints, facilitating a forward-leaning posture. Subsequently, the elbow joint extends to present the hand outward toward the receiver. Upon completion, the arm retracts, bending at the elbow, and returns to a resting position along the side of the body.
In the "Hand waving" action sequence, the primary motion involves the shoulder and elbow joints. The action begins with the shoulder joint rotating, elevating the arm sideways, followed by an upward and outward movement of the forearm, facilitated by the elbow joint bending. This motion cycles repetitively in a wave-like rhythm. The wrist joint adds to the fluidity of the wave, making slight adjustments to the orientation of the hand, enhancing the smoothness of the waving gesture. Throughout the sequence, the upper arm remains mostly elevated, with the elbow moving in a synchronous arc pattern, coordinating with rhythmic shoulder rotations to convey the waving action.
In the "Handshaking" action sequence, two individuals approach each other and extend their right arms forward. The dominant movement involves the shoulder joints rotating to allow the extension of the arms, followed by the elbow joints locking as the hands meet. The wrists flex slightly upon contact to accommodate a firm grip. Concurrently, their opposite arms remain relatively stationary, with minor adjustments in shoulder and elbow positions for balance. The handshake typically involves a series of up and down movements primarily driven by the elbow joints flexing and extending in a controlled manner. Once the handshake concludes, both individuals retract their arms, reversing the initial extension movement at the shoulder and elbow joints.
In the "Hopping (one foot jumping)" action sequence, the skeletal motion pattern involves continuous, rhythmic vertical displacement primarily distinguished by the flexion and extension of the knee and hip joints of the supporting leg. The ankle joint stabilizes and adjusts to maintain balance. The non-supporting leg is held relatively stable, slightly flexed at the hip and knee to keep it off the ground. The arm joints on both sides exhibit alternating swings that counterbalance the movements of the legs, with shoulder and elbow joints facilitating this compensatory motion to maintain upper body balance and momentum throughout the hopping sequence.
In the "Hugging other person" sequence, the human skeleton exhibits a distinct motion pattern starting with the shoulder joints rotating to extend the arms outward while the elbow joints flex to reduce the angle, bringing the forearms inward and closer together. Concurrently, the wrist joints slightly flex to facilitate a gentle grasp as the arms wrap around the other person. The hip joints adjust minimally to maintain balance, while the knee joints ensure stability of stance with minor flexion adjustments. Throughout the hug, the spine remains relatively erect with slight anterior flexion at the lumbar region to enhance the closeness of the embrace, finishing as the joints retract back to the initial posture.
In the "Jumping up" sequence, the action begins with the knees bending as the hip joints flex, lowering the body's center of gravity. The ankle joints dorsiflex, preparing for an upward propulsion. As the jump initiates, a rapid extension of the knees and hips occurs, while the ankles plantarflex to push off the ground, maximizing the upward momentum. The arms swing upward with shoulders and elbows extending, aiding in lift and balance. At the peak of the jump, the limbs briefly align vertically with the body before flexing again at the knees and hips to absorb the impact upon landing.
In the action sequence of "Kicking other person," the human skeletal motion begins with a shift in weight to one leg, stabilizing the body. Simultaneously, the opposite leg’s hip joint flexes, bringing the knee forward and upward, while the ankle extends, preparing for the kick. The torso leans slightly away from the kick to maintain balance. As the kick reaches peak extension, the hip joint rapidly extends, propelling the leg forward, with the knee straightening out aggressively. Upon impact or completion of the kick, the leg retracts, bending at the knee and hip to return to a stable, balanced position.
In the action sequence labeled "Kicking something," the skeletal motion pattern commences with the torso tilting slightly backward as the hip joint on the kicking side extends, with accompanying flexion and abduction. The knee of the kicking leg initially flexes then rapidly extends as the high point of the kick is targeted. Concurrently, the non-kicking leg's knee maintains slight flexion for balance, and the ankle stabilizes. The shoulder joints remain relatively static, though they might retract slightly for balance. The arms' positions adjust for counterbalance, typically with elbows flexing and hands raised or extending outward. The action culminates in the rapid retraction and flexion of the kicking leg's hip and knee joints.
In the sequence labeled "Making a phone call/answering phone," the action begins with the dominant arm elevating from a neutral position alongside the body. The shoulder joint abducts and flexes, guiding the elbow to bend approximately 90 degrees. Simultaneously, the forearm pronates as the wrist extends slightly, positioning the hand near the ear. The head remains relatively stable, with a slight tilt towards the shoulder of the raised arm as the action progresses. The nondominant arm typically maintains a lower, more static position, potentially with slight adjustments in elbow flexion or wrist orientation to aid balance or gesture.
In the "Patting on the back of another person" sequence, the primary actor initiates the action with shoulder abduction, concurrently elevating the elbow and maintaining slight flexion at the wrist joint to position the hand flat against the other person's back. This is followed by repetitive, gentle flexion and extension of the elbow, enabling the hand to pat in an up-and-down motion. The shoulder remains relatively stable throughout the sequence with slight rotations to accommodate the elbow's flexion and extension. The action generally concludes with the retraction of the arm, leading to shoulder adduction, and elbow extension as the hand withdraws.
In the "Pickup" action sequence, the human skeleton initiates movement by tilting the torso forward, simultaneously bending the knees and hips to lower the body towards the ground. The arms extend downwards with elbows slightly flexed, aligning the hands with the lower torso. As the body approaches a full crouch, the shoulders rotate subtly to ensure the arms are positioned directly below the shoulders. The wrists maintain a neutral position throughout. The action culminates as the individual lifts the torso back to an upright position, concurrently straightening the knees and hips, and elevating the arms upwards in a controlled ascent, completing the pickup motion.
In the action sequence termed "Playing with phone/tablet," the skeletal motion primarily centers around the upper body. The wrists exhibit frequent flexion and slight rotation as the elbows maintain a relatively stable but slightly flexed position, creating a consistent angle in relation to the torso. Shoulders show minimal elevation and depression, remaining mostly neutral but occasionally rotating inward as the arms adjust position. The spine sustains an upright or slightly leaned-forward posture, and the head is predominantly stable but occasionally tilts slightly forward, aligning with minor adjustments in the torso and arm positions, especially when interacting for extended periods.
In the "Pointing finger at the other person" action sequence, the movement primarily involves the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and finger joints of one arm. Initially, the shoulder joint raises the arm to direct the forearm forward, aligning with the target. Concurrently, the elbow joint extends to straighten the arm, positioning the hand in front of the torso, though it remains vertically below shoulder level. The wrist joint adjusts to orient the palm facing inward. The final critical movement is the extension of one finger, facilitated by the joints in the finger, pointing it directly at the other person, while the remaining fingers curl slightly inward. This sequence unfolds sequentially and smoothly from shoulder to fingertip.
In the action sequence labeled "Pointing to something with finger," the human skeleton primarily exhibits movement in the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints of one arm. Initially, the shoulder joint elevates slightly while the arm extends forward, aligning the elbow and wrist joints in a relatively straight line directed towards the target. The elbow joint remains slightly flexed, then fully extends as the motion progresses. Concurrently, the wrist extends to emphasize the pointing gesture. The fingers are primarily extended, with the index finger distinctly separated and directed outward, accentuating the pointing action. The opposite arm typically remains in a neutral or slightly adjusted position to maintain balance.
In the action sequence of "Punching/slapping another person," the human skeleton exhibits distinct movements primarily involving the upper limbs. Initially, the shoulder of the striking arm retracts, aligning with a slight torso rotation towards the opposite side, which preloads the muscles. Subsequently, the elbow of the same arm extends rapidly, projecting the forearm forward, while the wrist maintains a firm position to ensure maximal impact. Synchronously, the opposite arm might retract slightly for balance. The lower body, particularly the hips and knees, stabilizes the stance with minimal movements, while the feet may pivot slightly to enhance force and maintain equilibrium throughout the action.
In the action sequence "Pushing other person," the human skeletal movement begins with the feet planted approximately shoulder-width apart to maintain balance. The knees slightly flex to lower the center of gravity. Concurrently, the spine extends slightly to shift the upper body forward. The elbows, initially bent, extend forcefully in conjunction with the shoulders, which also move from a neutral position to full extension forward. This arm extension is critical, pushing in a directed motion towards the other individual. The wrists remain relatively fixed to transmit the force effectively. As the action progresses, the hips pivot slightly to maximize force delivery, with the shoulders and arms retracting slightly at the end to regain balance.
In the action sequence of "Put on a hat/cap," the subject initiates the motion by lifting their arms, primarily through the flexion at the elbow and shoulder joints. The hands, connected via the wrist joints, are raised above the head, with palms facing downward or slightly toward each other. As the hands approach the top of the head, a slight outward rotation of the shoulders coupled with elbow extension positions the hands directly above the head. Conclusively, the arms are lowered back down to the sides of the body, completing the action by extending the elbows and slightly downward rotating the shoulder joints.
In the sequence "Put something inside pocket," the person typically begins with both the shoulder and elbow of one arm flexing to bring the hand towards the torso. Concurrently, the wrist may rotate slightly for proper hand alignment. As the hand approaches the pocket area, generally located on either side of the hips, there's further flexion at the elbow and wrist to facilitate entry into the pocket. The shoulder may also elevate or rotate slightly to ensure smoother hand trajectory. Once the hand is inserted into the pocket, the elbow and shoulder extend back towards a neutral position, completing the action sequence.
In the "Reading" action sequence, the primary joint activity involves the elbows, wrists, and shoulders. Initially, the elbows are bent approximately at a right angle, and wrists are mildly flexed, positioning the hands steady in mid-air at chest level, suggesting a holding gesture. Throughout the sequence, the shoulders exhibit minimal movement, remaining relatively stable to support the arm posture. Gradually, slight periodic adjustments are made at the wrists and elbows, subtly altering the angle and orientation of the forearms, likely to shift the viewing angle or to flip pages. This reading pattern is characterized by its repetitiveness and the limited range of motion in the upper limbs.
In the action sequence "Rub two hands together," the primary movement involves the wrists, shoulders, and elbows. Initially, the shoulders slightly rotate inward, positioning the hands in front of the body with palms facing each other. The elbows are flexed at approximately right angles, stabilizing the position of the forearms, which are held parallel to each other and perpendicular to the body's torso. Subsequently, the wrists exhibit rotational movements around their axes, causing the hands to repetitively slide across each other in a horizontal plane. These wrist rotations are gentle yet rapid, ensuring continuous and smooth hand movements throughout the sequence.
In the "Salute" sequence, the motion begins with the subject's dominant arm initially at their side. The shoulder joint then elevates, guiding the entire arm upward and forward in a fluid motion. Simultaneously, the elbow flexes, bringing the hand close to the forehead. The hand remains parallel to the head throughout the gesture. The wrist exhibits minimal movement, maintaining a steady linear alignment with the forearm. Upon reaching the peak of the salute, the arm pauses briefly before the shoulder and elbow joints coordinate to reverse the action, smoothly lowering the arm back to the initial resting position at the side.
In the action sequence labeled "Sitting down", the individual initiates the motion by bending the hips and knees, bringing the torso forward and downward while the feet remain stationary. Simultaneously, the hip joints act as pivotal points; the angle between the thighs and the lower legs decreases. The arms may move slightly forward for balance, with elbows subtly flexing. As the individual descends, the spine flexes to accommodate the lowering of the body. The sequence culminates with the buttocks reaching the seated position, typically indicated by a leveling of the hips, and stabilization as the knees achieve their maximum bend.
In the "Standing up" sequence, the action begins with the hips and knees flexed while the individual is in a sitting position. Initially, there is extension at the knees as the feet press into the ground. Simultaneously, the hip joints also extend, transitioning the torso from a bent to a more upright position. The spine extends, aiding in straightening the upper body. As the action progresses, the shoulders move back slightly, aligning with the hips to maintain balance. Finally, the elbows, previously bent if aiding in the push from a surface, now align along the sides of the body as the individual fully stands upright.
In the action sequence titled "Take off a hat/cap," the primary skeletal movement initiates with the shoulder joints elevating, followed by elbow joints flexing as both forearms ascend to head height. Concurrently, the wrists flex as hands position themselves around the top of the head. Subsequently, the wrists supinate slightly to grasp and the elbows maintain flexion while the hands coordinately move upwards and backwards in a smooth arc, guiding the associated forearm and shoulder movements. Throughout the sequence, the spine stays relatively erect with minor adjustments for balance, while lower limbs maintain a stable, stationary posture to support the upper body dynamics.
In the action sequence labeled "Take off glasses," the primary motion involves the upper body. Initially, the elbows are bent, with the hands raised towards the head, primarily using the shoulder and elbow joints. The hands are aligned with the ears, predominantly involving the wrist and finger joints to grasp. Subsequently, the wrists rotate slightly outward and upwards as the hands pull away from the face, leading to a lateral movement of the arms. The shoulder joints facilitate this outward arm extension, returning to a more neutral position as the hands lower once the glasses are removed, completing the action sequence.
In the "Take off jacket" action sequence, the individual begins by extending the arms laterally with elbows slightly flexed. Sequentially, the dominant hand grips the opposite sleeve's cuff, pulling the sleeve down and over the hand, involving elbow flexion followed by extension. Subsequently, the person shifts their torso slightly to assist the non-dominant arm in reversing the same action—pulling the sleeve over the hand through increased elbow flexion before releasing. The action culminates as the person pulls the jacket off by extending both arms backward, primarily through shoulder abduction, and finally lowering the arms to the sides, completing the jacket removal.
In the "Take out something from pocket" action sequence, the skeletal motion begins with the shoulder of the acting arm (typically the dominant one) elevating slightly while the elbow flexes, bringing the forearm and hand towards the hip area. Concurrently, the wrist adjusts, orienting the hand appropriately to enter the pocket. The fingers flex as they grasp the object, and the shoulder then abducts slightly as the elbow extends, retracting the arm back upwards and in front of the body. The wrist rotates as the object is brought into view, completing the sequence with the hand stabilizing in a neutral position.
In the action sequence "Taking a selfie," the individual first raises one arm, flexing at the shoulder and elbow to position the hand approximately in front of the face. Simultaneously, the other arm either assists by grasping the device or remains at rest. The wrists flex slightly to stabilize and orient a device held in the elevated hand. The head adjusts, typically tilting slightly towards the raised hand and rotating minimally to align the face parallel to the implied angle of the device. Throughout the sequence, the torso remains relatively stable with minimal bending or twisting, anchoring the posture as the limbs move.
In the "Tear up paper" action sequence, the skeletal motion primarily involves the upper body. The sequence commences with both arms elevating, particularly the elbows and the accompanying flexion at the shoulders, as the hands converge in front of the torso. Fingers are positioned close to each other, simulating a grasp. Subsequent motions involve repetitive alternating bilateral shoulder abduction and adduction, while the elbows maintain a degree of flexion, oscillating between slight extension and flexion. This pattern repeats several times, indicating the primary action of tearing, with the hands moving linearly apart and together in coordination with the involved joint movements. The arms eventually lower, signaling the end of the action.
In the "Throw" action sequence, the skeletal motion begins with the feet planted firmly apart for stability. The hip initiates a slight rotation, aligning the body with the target direction. Concurrently, the shoulder of the throwing arm is drawn back while the elbow flexes, bringing the hand behind the body to generate momentum. The non-throwing arm extends outward for balance. As the throw progresses, the shoulder of the throwing arm rapidly rotates forward, extending the elbow. The wrist flicks at the point of release for added force. Simultaneously, the hips and torso rotate towards the throw direction to drive power through the motion, finishing with the throwing arm fully extended towards the target.
In the "Touch back (backache)" sequence, the human begins in a vertical stance. Initially, the shoulders slightly hunch forward while the elbows remain close to the body. The most significant skeletal movement occurs in the torso and spine, which bend backward subtly as the person starts to display discomfort. Concurrently, the hips retain their position, anchoring the movement largely in the upper body. The knees show minimal flexion, primarily responding to the shift in the upper body rather than initiating movement. Finally, the wrists gently flex as the hands reach towards the lower back, emphasizing the localized area of discomfort before returning to a neutral position.
In the human action sequence labeled "Touch chest (stomachache/heart pain)," the individual initiates the motion by raising one or both arms towards the chest. The shoulder joints are primarily involved, flexing to elevate the arms as the elbows bend to position the hands over the chest area. This motion typically centers the hands around the sternum or spreads them slightly to the side over the ribs, depending on the specific point of discomfort. Throughout the sequence, the wrists remain relatively stable, with slight adjustments to position the palms flat against the chest, maximizing contact. This movement is typically completed in a progressive, yet swift manner, emphasizing an urgent response to pain.
In the "Touch head (headache)" action, the sequence initiates with the upper limbs at rest along the sides of the body. Subsequently, the shoulder joints elevate, flexing upwards, followed by the elbow joints flexing to reduce the angle between the upper arms and forearms. The wrists also articulate to position the hands with an inward rotation toward the head. As the hands approach the head, primarily the temples or forehead, the fingers close slightly but not into a fist, maintaining a curved, relaxed posture. This movement is often symmetrical, involving both arms moving in tandem and culminating with the hands resting lightly on the head, before reversing the action and returning to the initial position.
In the "Touch neck (neckache)" action sequence, the skeletal motion begins with the subject’s upper limbs at rest along the sides of the torso. As the action commences, the elbow of one arm flexes while the corresponding shoulder joint elevates and slightly rotates internally, bringing the hand upwards towards the neck. The wrist flexes as the hand nears the neck, positioning the fingers to touch the back or side of the neck. The opposite arm remains relatively stationary, with minor adjustments for balance. This movement is typically sustained for a brief period before the arm retracts, returning the elbow, shoulder, and wrist to their initial resting positions.
In the action sequence labeled "Typing on a keyboard," skeletal motion predominantly involves the fingers, wrists, and elbows. Finger joints exhibit repetitive flexing and extending movements as they strike and release. Simultaneously, wrist joints perform subtle oscillatory movements to position the fingers accurately over the keyboard keys. Elbow joints show minimal flexion to stabilize the forearms in a horizontal orientation, facilitating smooth, controlled typing motion. The sequence is characterized by rapid, cyclic movements of the fingers, occasionally interspersed with short pauses, presumably as the hands shift positions across the keyboard, resulting in slight adjustments at the wrist and elbow joints.
In the action "Use a fan (with hand or paper)/feeling warm," the sequence commences with the shoulder joints raising slightly as the elbows flex, bringing the forearms closer to the torso. The wrists undertake a pivotal movement, predominantly along the horizontal plane, oscillating from side to side. This motion is rhythmical and repetitive, predominantly driven by the rotation and flexing of the wrist joints, with occasional slight adjustments from the elbow joints to maintain amplitude. Throughout the sequence, the upper arms remain relatively stable, with minimal involvement of the lower body; the torso stays straight yet may lean slightly backwards for balance as the action repeats.
In the "Wear Jacket" human action sequence, the individual initially exhibits extended elbow joints while the hands reach outwards to grab the jacket. Subsequently, the shoulders and elbows operate in conjunction; the arms lift and bend at the elbows, allowing the hands to guide the jacket over each shoulder sequentially. While the shoulders slightly rotate and abduct to slip the arms through the jacket sleeves, the spine remains mostly erect, offering minimal flexion or rotation. Completing the sequence, the individual adjusts the jacket by pulling down with both hands, which involves extension of the elbows and slight downward movement of the shoulders. Throughout this process, the hips and legs maintain a relatively stable position, providing support and balance for the upper body movements.
In the "Wear on glasses" action sequence, the skeletal motion begins with both upper limbs at rest along the torso. The elbows then flex, bringing both hands up to head height. Particularly, the hands approach the head laterally, converging in front of the face, while the wrists articulate to adjust the orientation of the palms forward, facing each other. Throughout this movement, the shoulders exhibit a mild elevation and abduction, stabilizing as the hands reach their target area near the eyes. The action concludes as the hands retract slightly and return to a resting posture along the torso, with elbows extending back to their initial positions.
In the "Wipe face" action sequence, the person primarily utilizes upper extremity movements. The sequence begins with both elbows bent as the hands approach the face, with the shoulders flexing slightly. The wrists flex to contour the hands closely over the face. The primary movement involves the hands moving in a sweeping motion from the forehead down to the chin, mediated by coordinated rotations and slight extensions of the wrists, elbows maintaining a semi-flexed position throughout. This motion is often repeated multiple times, with the arms finally lowering as the hands retreat to a resting position along the body, completing the action.
In the "Writing" action sequence, the dominant arm's shoulder remains relatively stable, while the elbow joint flexes periodically, maintaining a roughly consistent angle as the hand moves primarily in horizontal and slight vertical trajectories. The wrist articulates subtly, assisting in the fluidity of the hand's movements as it transfers across the paper. The fingers exhibit fine motor movements, alternately flexing and extending to manipulate the writing utensil with precision. The nondominant arm often stabilizes, with minimal movement in the shoulder and elbow joints, serving primarily to support the body or the writing surface. This sequence progresses smoothly, with repeated cycles of hand and finger movements punctuated by occasional adjustments in arm positioning.
