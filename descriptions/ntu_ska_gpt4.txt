In the "Drink water" action sequence, the skeletal motion begins with the upper limb, particularly the shoulder and elbow joints of one arm, elevating and flexing to bring the hand upward towards the head level, simulating holding a glass. The forearm and wrist joints articulate to position the hand directly in front of the face. As the elbow maintains flexion, there is slight stabilization noticeable in the shoulder girdle. Concurrently, minimal adjustments in the spine and neck may align the head slightly forward. Following this, the arm's motion reverses as it lowers back to the starting position by extending at the elbow and lowering at the shoulder.
In the "Eat meal/snack" action sequence, the most prominent skeletal movements occur primarily in the upper body. The sequence begins with the subject's elbow flexing while the shoulder joint stabilizes, bringing the hand towards the head. The wrist articulates slightly, aligning the hand in an orientation conducive to typical eating gestures. This motion repeats several times, exhibiting a cyclical pattern. Meanwhile, the head may tilt slightly forward, enhancing the reach and precision of the hand towards the face. Throughout this sequence, the spine remains relatively erect, with minor adjustments to maintain balance as the arms move.
In the "Brushing teeth" action sequence, the primary skeletal motion centers around the elbow and shoulder joints of the dominant arm. Initially, the shoulder joint displays minimal horizontal abduction, allowing the elbow to flex to approximately a 90-degree angle. Throughout the action, the elbow joint repeatedly extends and flexes in a consistent, rhythmic motion, maintaining alignment with the upper torso. The non-dominant arm remains relatively stable, with slight adjustments in shoulder and elbow joints to support body balance. Temporally, this motion pattern is continuous and repetitive, with a consistent cadence, reflecting the cyclical nature of the activity.
In the "Brushing hair" action sequence, the primary motion involves the elbow joint of one arm repeatedly flexing and extending as the arm moves vertically up and back down. The shoulder joint on the same side engages primarily in a combination of abduction and rotation, promoting high upward reach and a sweeping motion back to the neutral position. The wrist on the active arm exhibits slight flexion and rotations, adjusting the angle of the hand throughout the motion. Meanwhile, the opposite arm typically remains relatively stable, with minor adjustments in the shoulder and elbow joints for balance and posture maintenance. Throughout the sequence, the head may slightly tilt backward, facilitated by the neck's extension and flexion motions.
In the "Drop" action sequence, the initial posture begins upright with limbs at rest. As the action initiates, the shoulders lead with a downward and forward motion, followed closely by a bending at the elbows, which draw nearer to the body. The knees flex significantly, lowering the torso while the hips also hinge backward, facilitating a controlled descent. Concurrently, the ankles flex to accommodate the change in position, maintaining balance. The wrists marginally adjust in orientation to align with the forearm. Finally, as the sequence concludes, the body stabilizes in a lower crouched position, having transitioned smoothly from standing to a controlled lower posture.
In the "Pickup" action sequence, the human skeleton initially displays a vertical stance. As the action progresses, the hip and knee joints flex, lowering the torso while maintaining balance. Concurrently, the arm extending towards the target is primarily driven by shoulder flexion and elbow extension; the opposite arm may slightly abduct for balance. The wrists remain relatively stable. Upon reaching the lowest point, the lumbar spine flexes slightly as the knees and hips begin to extend, initiating an upward motion. This is mirrored in the stabilizing role of the secondary arm, which adjusts to maintain equilibrium, culminating in a return to the upright posture.
In the "Throw" action sequence, the human skeletal motion begins with the dominant arm cocking back, shoulder and elbow joints retracting while the opposite arm extends slightly for balance. The legs adjust for stability, with a slight bend in the knees, and the hips rotating to align with the throwing action. As the throw progresses, the dominant arm rapidly extends forward, elbow and shoulder joints opening fully. Concurrently, the rear leg pushes off, aiding in the forward propulsion of the body, and the hips pivot to transfer energy from the lower body to the upper body, culminating in the release phase where the wrist flicks to optimize the trajectory of the throw.
In the action sequence of "Sitting down," the skeletal movement begins with the torso tilting slightly forward while the hips move backward and downward. Concurrently, there’s a noticeable flexion at the knee joints and the hips, as the individual lowers themselves. The ankles flex to accommodate the shifting body weight, aiding in balance. The arms typically move downward and slightly forward, sometimes with the elbows bending, to help stabilize the body during the descent. These skeletal shifts culminate with the hips positioned on a lowered plane, signifying that the individual has seated themselves, completing the motion pattern.
In the "Standing up" sequence, the action initiates with the hips and knees flexed in a sitting position. The person first leans slightly forward, increasing the flexion in the hips. This movement shifts the center of gravity forward, prompting the knees to extend gradually. Concurrently, the ankles dorsiflex. As the torso ascends, the spinal joints extend. The hips continue to extend, aided by the thigh muscles, driving the body upward. Shoulder joints remain relatively stable while the arms may assist in balance by extending at the elbow or moving slightly outward, completing the transition from sitting to a fully upright stance.
In the "Clapping" action sequence, skeletal analysis reveals a repetitive closing and opening motion of the arms. This is coordinated primarily through the flexion and extension at the elbow joints, while the shoulders experience a slight abduction and adduction, moving outward then inward respectively. Alongside, the wrists flex bringing the palms together and then extend as the hands part. These maneuvers follow a rhythmic sequence, with each clap initiating at the elbows' neutral position, proceeding to full flexion to bring the palms together in the midline of the body, then returning to the starting position. The sequence displays a smooth, bilateral symmetrical movement pattern.
In the "Reading" action sequence, the skeletal motion primarily involves the upper body. The elbow joints exhibit slight flexion and extension as the forearms adjust the positioning of the upper limbs, maintaining a steady proximal position relative to the torso. Periodic, minimal rotations and tilts of the cervical spine (neck) reflect subtle head movements to adjust the line of sight and alleviate static tension. The wrists exhibit minor flexion adjusting the angle of the hands, likely holding reading material. Throughout the sequence, the lower body remains largely stationary, with occasional slight shifts in the hip joints to reposition for comfort.
In the "Writing" sequence, the skeletal motion mainly involves the arm and hand. The shoulder joint remains relatively stationary, with minor adjustments for comfort and positioning. The elbow exhibits slight flexion and extension to bring the hand into an appropriate writing posture. The primary movement occurs at the wrist, which varies between mild flexion and extension, adapting as the pen moves across the paper. The fingers, particularly at the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, show dynamic flexion and extension, responding to the need for grip adjustments on the writing instrument. These movements occur sequentially and are often repeated, reflecting the rhythmic nature of writing.
In the "Tear up paper" action sequence, the human skeletal motion begins with the upper limbs raising parallel to shoulder height, elbows bent. Both hands, approximately aligned with each wrist, start close together, palms inward. The forearms then enact a pulling motion, as the hands move outward away from each other horizontally, stretching the paper until it tears. This key motion involves significant outward rotation at the shoulders and elbows extending slightly. The wrists maintain their orientation relative to the forearms throughout. The action culminates as the hands reach their maximum separation, completing the tear, before retracting slightly towards the body.
In the "Wear Jacket" action sequence, the individual begins by lifting both arms, typically bending at the elbows, to initiate sliding into the jacket sleeves. The shoulders show an upward and backward rotation to accommodate the jacket, progressing sequentially—first one arm, then the other, aligning each arm with its respective sleeve. Following this, the elbows flex to pull the jacket over the forearms and wrists, facilitating the adjustment of the jacket's fit. The subsequent movements involve reaching across the body with one hand to adjust the opposite side of the jacket, often involving shoulder abduction and rotations, before finally lowering the arms to a resting position.
In the "Take off jacket" action sequence, the individual begins by extending their arms laterally with elbows bent slightly, implying separation of the jacket from the torso. Subsequently, the dominant hand grasps the opposite sleeve, initiating a cross-body pull that involves the shoulder and elbow joints of the non-dominant arm moving horizontally across the body and the dominant arm executing extension and rotation at the shoulder to facilitate the pull. As the jacket is pulled over the arm, the elbow joint of the non-dominant arm flexes to allow the sleeve to slide off, followed by similar movements performed by the other arm to fully remove the jacket. This sequence ends with both arms lowering to the sides, completing the removal process.
In the "Wear a shoe" action sequence, the video depicts a notable pattern of skeletal movement primarily involving the lower limbs and pelvis. Initially, the hip joint flexes as one leg bends and lifts slightly, facilitating knee flexion and slight ankle dorsiflexion to position the foot appropriately. Concurrently, there is a subtle tilt in the pelvis and a balancing contraction in the opposite leg to maintain stability. The action progresses as the knee of the shoe-wearing leg extends slightly, along with mild hip extension to adjust and secure the foot’s position. Throughout, the upper limbs exhibit moderate flexion at the elbow joints, assisting in guiding the foot while the shoulder joints remain relatively stable, focusing the movement on precise lower limb joint manipulation. The sequence culminates as the joints stabilize, returning to an upright, balanced posture.
In the "Take off a shoe" action sequence, the individual begins by slightly bending the knee of the leg from which the shoe will be removed, maintaining balance with the other leg grounded. The hip of the raised leg may tilt outward or rotate slightly to facilitate shoe removal. Concurrently, the arms move downward as both elbows flex, directing the hands towards the foot of the raised leg. The hands grasp the shoe, involving primarily finger joint flexion. The wrist articulates to adjust the grip as required. Subsequently, the leg may elevate or extend slightly at the knee to assist in pulling off the shoe, finishing with a return to an upright standing position as the arms lower the removed shoe.
In the "Wear on glasses" sequence, the primary action involves the arms. Initially, both elbows flex, and the shoulders abduct and externally rotate, bringing the hands towards the head. The wrists pronate slightly as the hands approach the sides of the head. Movements are symmetrical and coordinated, with a brief pause as the hands reach head height, suggesting stabilization. Following this, the forearms slightly supinate as the hands move towards each other, typically aligning along the sagittal plane of the head. This concludes with a slight downward motion of the wrists, finally stabilizing into a rest position.
In the "Take off glasses" action, the sequence begins with the upper limbs at rest along the sides of the torso. The elbow joints flex, bringing the forearms upward and inward toward the head, while the hands, pivoting mainly at the wrist joints, approach the sides of the head. Simultaneously, the shoulder joints exhibit slight abduction and rotation to facilitate the hand movements towards the head. The hands briefly converge at the region near the ears, primarily manipulating through coordinated wrist flexion and extension. Following this, the elbows extend, lowering the forearms and returning the hands to the initial resting position along the torso.
In the "Put on a hat/cap" action sequence, skeletal movements begin with the shoulder joints elevating, as the elbow joints flex, bringing the hands towards the head. Concurrently, the wrists extend slightly to orient the palms adequately. As the hands reach head level, the elbows experience further flexion. The primary movements occur in the shoulder joints which rotate, facilitating hand placement above the head. Subtle adjustments occurring in the cervical vertebrae tilt the head slightly backwards, creating room for the cap placement. The action concludes as the shoulder joints slightly retract, and the elbow joints extend, lowering the hands back to a resting position.
In the action sequence "Take off a hat/cap," the primary skeletal movements involve the arm joints and the upper body. Initially, the elbows flex, bringing the hands upwards towards the head. Simultaneously, the wrists rotate slightly to allow for a proper grip. As the hands reach the head level, the shoulder joints elevate and abduct, facilitating hand placement on either side of the head. The sequence progresses as the arms coordinate in lifting the hands upwards and slightly back, primarily driven by the extension of the elbows along with the rotative adjustment of the wrists to maintain grasp orientation. Finally, the arms return to the sides of the body as the hands lower, following a reversed path of joint articulation.
In the "Cheer up" action sequence, the individual begins with a neutral stance, arms at their sides. As the sequence progresses, both arms are raised laterally until hands are above the head, with elbows slightly bent. Simultaneously, the shoulders elevate, and this upper limb movement is typically symmetric. Following the arm raise, there is a brief pause, then the arms are swiftly lowered back to the initial position. Throughout this action, the spine remains erect with minimal flexion or extension, and the lower body maintains stability with minor adjustments in knee flexion to balance the dynamic upper body movements.
In the "Hand waving" sequence, the primary skeletal motion involves the shoulder and elbow joints of one or both arms. Beginning from a neutral position, the shoulder joint abducts, raising the arm laterally, while the elbow may flex slightly to provide a relaxed wave. This motion is cyclically reversed, bringing the arm back down approximately to the starting position, and is then repeated several times. Throughout the sequence, the wrist remains relatively stable with slight adjustments to keep the hand oriented appropriately. The amplitude of the entire movement can vary, affecting how high and how broadly the arm swings. This rhythmic pattern progresses in a loop for the duration of the action.
In the "Kicking something" action sequence, the movement initiates with a shift in weight to the supporting leg, causing a slight bending at the knee and hip joints for stability. Concurrently, the opposite hip joint flexes, lifting the kicking leg with an increasing angle at the knee. As the leg reaches the desired height, the knee extends rapidly, pointing the foot forward in a sharp, linear motion. The pelvis slightly rotates towards the kicking leg, enhancing the kick’s force through upper body involvement. Following the kick, the leg retracts, bending at the knee, and settles back into the initial stance with weight evenly distributed between both legs.
In the "Reach into pocket" action sequence, the upper body tilts slightly while the shoulder of the arm that is reaching initiates the movement by rotating forward and downward. This is followed by the elbow joint flexing to bring the forearm closer towards the body, with the wrist orienting the hand appropriately. Concurrently, the hip on the same side as the reaching arm subtly shifts to balance the body, allowing slight flexion of the spine for enhanced reach. As the hand approaches the target area, typically the hip pocket region, the shoulder and elbow extend slightly to facilitate accurate positioning of the hand.
In the "Hopping (one foot jumping)" sequence, the primary skeletal motion involves repetitive, vertical displacements of the hip joint, consequently elevating and lowering the torso. The knee of the supporting leg periodically flexes and extends to absorb impact and propel the body upward. Simultaneously, the ankle joint flexes to push off from the ground and extends upon landing to cushion the impact. The non-supporting leg maintains a slight, constant bend at the knee and hip to stabilize the body and counterbalance the motion. Arm joints exhibit a coordinated swinging motion with elbows slightly bent, aiding in maintaining balance and momentum throughout the action.
In the "Jumping up" action sequence, the human skeletal motion begins with the knees bending into a squat as the hip joints open slightly. The arms swing back in preparation, maximizing the engagement of the shoulder joints. This is followed by a swift upward extension of the legs, primarily through rapid straightening of the knee joints. Simultaneously, the arms thrust forward and upward, driven by the shoulder and elbow joints, aiding in upward momentum. At the peak of the jump, the body briefly achieves a straightened posture through the hip, knee, and ankle joints, before flexing again to cushion the landing.
In the "Make a phone call/Answer phone" action sequence, the human subject typically begins with the dominant arm elevated and bent at the elbow, bringing the hand towards the ear region, which is supported by a slight rotation of the shoulder joint. This elbow flexion is crucial and is accompanied by a minor wrist adjustment to position the hand as if holding a phone. Meanwhile, the head slightly tilts towards the raised hand. The non-dominant arm generally remains in a neutral or slightly adjusted position, potentially with minimal movements for balance or support. The rest of the body typically maintains a stable, upright posture during this brief sequence.
In the action sequence labeled “Playing with phone/tablet,” the primary movement occurs in the upper limbs. The shoulders remain relatively stable while the elbows typically bend between 45 to 90 degrees, positioning the forearms parallel or semi-vertical to the torso. The wrists enact subtle flexion or rotation, allowing the hands to maintain a steady and precise orientation. This upper body action is consistent and repetitive, with minimal involvement of the lower body, maintaining an upright or seated posture. Throughout the sequence, the head occasionally tilts slightly forward, aligning the eyes with the hands' movement to facilitate focused engagement.
In the action sequence "Typing on a Keyboard," the primary skeletal movements predominantly involve the joints of the arms. Both shoulders experience minor rotation and abduction to stabilize the forearms in a horizontal orientation pointing towards the midline. The elbow joints maintain a nearly constant angle slightly less than 90 degrees. Wrist joints exhibit periodic flexion and extension as the fingers articulate to strike keys. Finger joints especially on each hand go through repetitive flexion and extension. Throughout the sequence, the torso remains mostly static, with only slight adjustments in lumbar and cervical vertebrae to support continuous arm activity and maintain posture.
In the human action labeled "Pointing to something with finger," the sequence initiates with the shoulder joint raising the arm to an extended position, aligning horizontally with minimal elevation. As the arm reaches its extended state, the elbow joint straightens almost entirely, fostering a nearly linear alignment between the upper arm and forearm. Concurrently, the wrist joint enacts a slight flexion stabilizing the direction in which the index finger points, while the other fingers curl slightly into a relaxed fist. The pointing action typically culminates as the shoulder, elbow, and wrist hold steady, emphasizing the distal motion primarily conducted by the index finger. Throughout the sequence, the trunk remains mostly static, with subtle torso adjustments to support the arm's weight and balance.
In the "Taking a selfie" action sequence, the person begins with their arms down at their sides. Gradually, one arm (commonly the right) flexes at the elbow and shoulder joints, raising the hand upwards and in front of the face, positioning the elbow at a right angle. Simultaneously, the other arm either assists by holding the elbow of the arm holding the imaginary device or remains stationary. The wrists flex slightly to stabilize the posture. Over time, the head tilts slightly forward as the shoulder holding the device remains elevated. The sequence ends with the arm gradually lowering back to the initial position.
In the action sequence "Checking Time (from watch)," the primary skeletal motion involves the forearm and wrist. Initially, the upper arm remains fairly static, positioned close to the torso. The action initiates with the forearm flexing at the elbow, lifting upwards and slightly laterally, guided by the shoulder joint maintaining a small degree of abduction. Concurrently, the wrist undergoes ulnar deviation, orienting the inner surface of the wrist towards the eyes. This movement brings the wrist joint into the viewer's line of sight. After a brief pause, the forearm returns to its initial position by extending at the elbow, and the wrist returns to a neutral position.
In the "Rubbing two hands together" action, the primary skeletal motion involves the wrists and elbow joints. Initially, both arms are oriented forward, with the elbows slightly bent. The wrists exhibit alternating proximal and distal rotations, keeping the palms in constant contact. This is accompanied by a moderate degree of flexion and extension in the elbows, synchronizing the up-and-down movement of the hands. The shoulders remain relatively stable, providing a fixed axis around which the forearms can rotate. The rhythmic motion of the hands rubbing against each other continues seamlessly, following a repetitive, cyclical pattern throughout the sequence.
In the "Nod headbow" sequence, the primary motion involves the cervical region, where the neck flexes causing the head to incline forward and then return to its original position. This action is typically repeated multiple times. As the cervical vertebrae articulate, there is minimal or no significant movement observable in the thoracic or lumbar spine regions, suggesting a largely isolated head and neck action. The shoulders remain mostly stable with slight adjustments to maintain balance, and the arms are relatively stationary, held in a natural position along the body. There tends to be no notable movement in the legs and feet, which maintain a steady base throughout the sequence.
In the "Shake head" action sequence, the primary motion involves the cervical section of the spine that supports the skull. The head initiates a lateral movement to one side, reaching a peak displacement before reversing direction towards the opposite side in a smooth, repetitive pendulum-like pattern. This action mainly engages the neck joints, ensuring minimal engagement of the shoulder girdle. Throughout the sequence, the torso remains mostly stationary, serving as a stable base, which isolates the movement to the neck and head. The action sequentially alternates from side to side, typically for multiple cycles, reflecting a consistent rhythm and amplitude.
In the "Wiping face" action sequence, the individual begins with both arms hanging naturally at their sides. Initially, the shoulder joints rotate, causing the arms to elevate laterally, particularly focusing on the elbow and wrist joints as the hands approach the face. The elbows flex to bring the hands closer to the face, predominantly in the frontal plane. Simultaneously, both wrists flex as the palms face towards the face, facilitating a covering motion over the face from the chin upwards. Throughout this sequence, the head remains relatively stationary, with slight nods possibly occurring as the hands make contact with different facial areas. After completing the wiping motion, the individual reverses the arm movement, lowering the hands and returning them to the initial resting position at the sides.
In the "Salute" action sequence, the skeletal motion pattern begins with the person in a neutral stance. The right arm is raised, bending at the elbow, while the forearm moves upwards until the hand reaches forehead level, aligning the forearm vertically. Simultaneously, the shoulder joint elevates slightly to accommodate the raised arm's position. The wrist remains straight, maintaining alignment with the forearm throughout the motion. After a brief pause, the right arm retraces its path in reverse, descending back to the initial neutral position by the side of the body. This progression ensures a smooth and precise execution of the salute gesture.
In the action sequence "Putting the palms together," the initial position generally starts with the arms extended or at rest along the sides. Subsequently, the shoulders abduct and externally rotate, facilitating the upward and inward movement of the humerus. Concurrently, the elbows flex, bringing the forearms toward the midline of the body. The wrists also undergo slight flexion to allow the palms of the hands to meet squarely in front of the chest. This culminates in the palms coming together centrally, typically at chest or face height, before retracting along the same path if the motion is reversed.
In the action sequence titled "Crossing hands in front (saying stop)," the individual begins with both arms hanging naturally at the sides. The elbows then flex, and the shoulders abduct and externally rotate, guiding the hands to move in an upward and inward trajectory across the body. As the forearms become approximately horizontal, the wrists slightly extend, positioning the hands parallel and centered relative to the torso, briefly maintaining this crossed arm posture. Throughout this motion, the spine remains erect, and the lower limbs stabilize the stance with slight adjustments in the hip and knee joints to maintain balance, concluding with a return to the rest position.
In the "Sneeze/cough" sequence, the human skeleton exhibits a distinct pattern beginning with a noticeable contraction of the torso as the spine flexes forward and the shoulders elevate slightly. During this phase, the elbows usually flex, bringing the hands towards the face area, predominantly in front of the mouth and nose region, as denoted by the displacement of the wrist joints. Concurrently, the head tilts downward, led by the neck's flexion. The action culminates as the torso straightens after the forward flexion, the head returns to a neutral position, and the arms lower back to the sides of the body or resting positions.
In the "Staggering" action sequence, the human skeleton displays an irregular, unsteady gait initiated by uneven weight shifts from one leg to the other. The hip joints alternate in abrupt lateral displacements, causing noticeable tilts in the pelvis and sporadic broadening of the stance. The knee joints intermittently flex more than normal during weight transfer, often leading to sudden, brief lowering of the body’s vertical position. The ankles show unstable flexion and extension, contributing to erratic foot placement. Meanwhile, the shoulder joints have a slight, asynchronous rotation, and the elbows subtly bend and extend to counterbalance the torso's unsteady motion throughout the sequence.
In the "Falling" action sequence, the initial stance showcases a vertical alignment of the hips, shoulders, and head joints. As the action initiates, there is a notable descending motion of the hip joint indicating loss of balance, coupled with an irregular, rapid downward trajectory. The knees generally flex to absorb impact or involuntarily buckle, contributing to the descent. Concurrently, the shoulder joints often rise reflexively, while the elbow joints may flex as the arms extend outward or forward to mitigate impact. The culmination of the fall is marked by a significant, abrupt drop and stabilization of all major joints in proximity to the ground.
In the "Touching head (headache)" action sequence, the individual begins with both arms hanging loosely at their sides. Firstly, the elbows flex, followed by a bilateral upward movement of the upper arms, guiding the forearms and hands towards the head. The wrists flex as the hands reach the head, predominantly contacting the frontal and temporal regions. During the peak of the movement, the hands may apply slight pressure or initiate small rubbing motions. Subsequently, the elbows extend to lower the arms back to the initial resting position, completing the action sequence with the movement primarily involving shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints.
In the motion pattern described for "Touching chest (stomachache/heart pain)," the action initiates with the elevation and inward rotation of both shoulders, leading to flexion at the elbow joints, particularly noticeable in the dominant arm. The hands, following shoulder and elbow movements, converge towards the chest area, predominantly involving the dominant hand making contact slightly below the collar bone, while the non-dominant hand supports just underneath. The wrists remain relatively stable throughout the sequence with minimal flexion or extension. This motion culminates in the hands pressing lightly against the chest before gradually retracting along the same path as extended.
In the "Touching back (backache)" action sequence, the person initially stands upright then gradually flexes the spine forward while slightly bending the knees. Concurrently, the shoulders droop forward as the arms extend and the elbows slightly flex, positioning the hands towards the lower back. This engagement primarily involves the elbow and shoulder joints in a reaching motion towards the lumbar region. The wrists flex as the hands make contact with the back, providing support or pressure. Eventually, the person returns to an upright posture by extending the elbows, and straightening the spine and legs, reversing the initial motions.
In the "Touching neck (neckache)" sequence, the individual begins with arms at their sides. Gradually, the elbows flex and the shoulders abduct and externally rotate, allowing the hands to elevate towards the neck. One hand, typically the dominant one, reaches to grasp or press against the back or side of the neck, suggesting an attempt to alleviate discomfort. Simultaneously, the head may tilt slightly towards the shoulder on the side of the affected neck, reducing neck extension and slightly rotating towards the opposite side, easing the strain on the neck muscles. This sequence often concludes with the hand retreating and the head returning to a neutral position.
In the "Nausea or vomiting" action sequence, the skeletal motion typically starts with the shoulders slumping forward and the spine bending slightly towards the ground as the torso leans forward. Concurrently, the elbows may bend as the hands come closer to stabilize around the abdomen or near the knees. The knees occasionally flex slightly as stabilization enhances when the torso moves downward. This forward motion of the torso is usually followed by an abrupt straightening of both the spine and elbows in repetitive sequences. Throughout, the head tilts forward in alignment with the spine's curvature, and briefly recoils during the upward spinal motion.
In the skeletal motion pattern of "Using a fan (with hand or paper)," the primary action involves the wrist and elbow joints of one arm. Initially, the elbow is slightly flexed while the wrist undergoes cycles of flexion and extension. This oscillatory movement is synchronized with slight shoulder joint rotations to allow a broader range of motion, increasing the effective area influenced by the fanning action. The opposite arm remains relatively stationary, with minor adjustments to maintain balance. The action progresses as repeated cycles of coordinated wrist and elbow movements create a rhythmic, consistent motion pattern throughout the sequence.
In the "Punching/Slapping other person" action sequence, the individual initiates movement with a rotation of the torso, aligning the shoulder of the striking arm with the target. Simultaneously, the elbow joint of the striking arm flexes, retracting the forearm towards the body. This pre-striking phase concludes as the shoulder joint propels forward and rotates, extending the arm rapidly towards the target. The elbow straightens as the hand moves through space to connect with the intended area. The shoulder on the non-striking side stabilizes the upper body, slightly retracting to counterbalance the force exerted. The sequence concludes as the limbs return to a neutral, relaxed state post-strike.
In the "Kicking other person" action sequence, the skeletal movement begins with the person shifting their weight onto one leg, typically the non-dominant leg, causing the hip and knee joint of the weight-bearing leg to flex slightly for stability. Concurrently, the other leg is lifted from the ground, with acceleration primarily originating from the hip joint extending, joined by knee joint flexion, raising the leg to achieve maximum reach and impact potential. The raised foot’s ankle joint extends to point the toe, optimizing the limb's configuration for force application. Following the kick, the striking leg retracts, with knee and hip joints flexing to return to a neutral, standing position, completing the motion sequence.
In the "Pushing other person" action, the skeletal motion begins with the perpetrator's feet planted firmly, shoulder-width apart, to maintain balance. The elbows bend, retracting the arms close to the body, creating an accumulation of potential energy in the shoulder and elbow joints. As the action progresses, the arms extend vigorously forward. This primary motion predominantly involves the shoulders and elbows moving in a coordinated push, with the wrists maintaining relative stability to enforce directed force. Throughout the sequence, the hip joints slightly rotate and shift forward, assisting the upper body in exerting maximal force, while the knees mildly flex to support the dynamic body movement.
In the "Patting on the back of another person" sequence, the primary actor's shoulder joint elevates and the elbow flexes, bringing the hand towards the other person’s upper back. This movement involves the abduction and slight external rotation of the shoulder to accommodate the patting range. Repeatedly, the wrist maintains a stable position while the forearm moves in a gentle, rhythmic tapping motion controlled by alternating contractions of the biceps and triceps. Simultaneously, the actor may slightly lean forward, involving subtle flexion at the hip joints. These actions are cyclic until the sequence concludes, marker by the shoulder returning to a neutral position and the arm extending back down to the side.
The action sequence of “Pointing finger at the other person” commences with the elevation of one arm at the shoulder joint, typically the dominant side, pivoting outward and upward to approximately shoulder height. The elbow joint extends fully to straighten the arm, aligning it in the direction of pointing. Concurrently, the wrist remains relatively stable, while only one finger, usually the index, extends outwards, with the other fingers flexing into a partial fist. The shoulder of the non-pointing arm generally remains neutral, providing balance and stabilization. This posture is held briefly before the arm retracts, following the reverse sequence: the finger flexes, elbow bends, and shoulder lowers the arm back to a resting position.
In the "Hugging other person" action sequence, the skeletal motion begins with both participants extending their arms towards each other, typically characterized by outward rotation and abduction at the shoulder joints along with elbow extension. As they approach, their torsos lean forward slightly. When sufficiently close, they wrap their arms around each other, involving adduction at the shoulders and flexion at the elbows, drawing their forearms inward. This phase may involve slight adjustments in wrist flexion to optimize the embrace. Finally, the hug concludes as both individuals retract their arms, reversing the earlier shoulder adduction and elbow flexion, returning to a neutral, upright stance.
In the action sequence labeled "Giving something to other person," the initiator begins by standing upright. The shoulder joint of one arm is first moved outward and forward, leading to elbow extension which reaches toward the receiver. Simultaneously, the wrist joint moderately supinates to facilitate the hand's orientation. As the giver transfers the invisible item, there is a brief overlap where both parties' hands, guided by their wrist and elbow joints, converge in space. Following this, the giver's arm retracts, leading to elbow flexion and a neutral alignment of the shoulder. Meanwhile, the recipient's arm mirrors this sequence in reverse, culminating in a withdrawal back to a neutral stance.
In the action sequence "Touching other person's pocket," the primary skeletal movements involve the initiator’s shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints of one arm. Initially, the shoulder joint is abducted and slightly flexed, guiding the elbow to bend and lift as the hand approaches the other person. Concurrently, the wrist flexes to orient the hand appropriately. As the arm extends toward the other person's pocket, there is a pronounced forward extension at the elbow, coupled with a slight outward rotation at the shoulder. Finally, the wrist undergoes subtle adjustments to optimize the orientation and positioning of the hand as it reaches the pocket.
In the "Handshaking" action sequence, two individuals approach each other, closing the distance between them. Initially, their arms are at their sides. As they near, both extend their right arms forward; the shoulder joints act as pivot points, enabling the outward movement of the humerus while the elbows extend almost fully to decrease the bend. The wrists engage lightly, supinating to present the palms. Their right hands meet midway, each grasping the other solidly. At their closest, minimal movement in their torsos and minimal additional shoulder adjustments help maintain balance and the handshake's integrity, before they retract their arms and step back to their initial positions.
In the "Walking towards each other" sequence, two human figures exhibit alternating bilateral leg movements characterized by the rhythmic bending and extending of hip and knee joints. As they approach, each figure maintains an upright posture with minimal spinal flexion. The shoulders and elbows display slight swinging motions that counterbalance the leg movements, enhancing stability. Each step begins with one leg’s hip flexing forward while the other extends backward, coupled with corresponding knee flexion and extension. This cyclical motion progresses steadily until the figures converge, at which point the forward momentum gradually diminishes, concluding as both figures stabilize in a new, closer proximity.
In the action sequence labeled "Walking apart from each other," each individual initially stands with their joints aligning vertically. The hip joints act as pivots while the legs initiate movement. In synchrony, one leg advances forward with the knee bending slightly before extending as the foot makes contact with the ground. The opposite arm simultaneously swings forward, elbow slightly bent. This alternating pattern of leg and arm movements continues in a rhythmic cycle. As each step progresses, the distance between the individuals increases as their shoulder joints move further apart, maintaining a steady, outward lateral displacement until they achieve full separation.
In the action sequence "Putting on headphones," the person begins with their arms relaxed by their sides. They then flex both elbows and extend their shoulder joints to raise their hands toward their head. As their hands reach the vicinity of their ears, the wrists rotate slightly for an optimal angle to grasp, usually one hand at a time. Their forearms remain elevated near head level. This sequence demonstrates a bilateral and symmetric use of the arm joints — shoulder flexion, elbow flexion, and minor wrist rotation — sustained momentarily as they adjust the position of each hand for a snug headphone fit, then reverting to a rest position by reversing the joint movements.
In the action sequence labeled "Taking off headphones," the skeletal motion begins with the head held upright as the elbows flex, and the shoulders mildly abduct to allow the hands, following the forearms' supination, to reach towards the ears simultaneously. The wrists flex as the hands grasp around the area of the head’s sides. The subsequent motion involves the elbows extending and slightly elevating, drawing the hands outward and upward in a smooth, coordinated arc away from the head, finishing with the forearms pronating as the hands move to a resting position, typically around the mid-torso level. This series of articulated joint movements completes the action sequence.
In the "Shooting at the basket" action sequence, the skeletal motion begins with the feet slightly apart, maintaining stability. The knees exhibit a slight bend to lower the center of gravity. The elbows bend with the hands raised near chest level, and the ball is presumed held by the hands moving into position. The action progresses with an upward extension of the knees and elbows, straightening the arms vertically above the shoulders. Simultaneously, the wrists flex to finalize the shooting motion. The movement concludes with a rapid return to an upright stance, lowering the arms and relaxing the knees once the shot is executed.
In the "Bouncing a ball" sequence, the human skeleton demonstrates distinct cyclical movements. The dominant arm performs an overhead downward swing, pivoting at the shoulder, bending at the elbow, and extending fully as the hand approaches the lowest position. Concurrently, the knees slightly flex to maintain balance and accommodate the arm's forceful motion, returning upright in sync with the arm resetting upward. The shoulder of the non-dominant arm stabilizes the torso by slightly retracting and balancing the swinging motion. This action repeats rhythmically, with each bounce, synchronizing the arm's downward swing and upward retrieval with the subtle squat and rise of the knees.
In the "Tennis bat swing" sequence, the human skeleton initiates the action with the feet slightly apart and the knees softly bent. The right arm, identified as the dominant one, draws back with the elbow flexing and the hand moving behind the body, rotating at the shoulder. Simultaneously, the left arm extends slightly forward for balance. As the swing progresses, there is a dynamic rotation through the hips and torso, channeling force from the lower body through to the upper body. The right shoulder moves forward, the elbow extends, and the wrist snaps at the point of the imagined impact, following through as the entire body rotates towards the target direction, settling into a balanced stance with the right arm now relaxed in front and the left arm returning to a neutral side position.
In the "Juggling table tennis balls" action sequence, the upper body exhibits the most dynamic joint movements. The shoulders alternately rise and rotate, facilitating upward and forward motions of the arms, which remain slightly bent at the elbows. The wrists engage in precise, repetitive, circular motions, critical for maintaining the sequence's rhythm. The hip joints show minimal movement, maintaining stability, while the knees occasionally flex to assist in subtle body shifts that support the upper body's actions. Throughout the sequence, the spine remains fairly erect, providing necessary support for the coordinated, cyclic movements of the upper limbs.
In the "Hushing" sequence, the primary skeletal motion involves the right arm. It begins with the shoulder joint elevating slightly as the elbow flexes, bringing the forearm close to the face. The wrist joint then flexes as the hand arrives near the lips, positioning the fingers vertically and close together. Throughout this period, the left arm remains stationary, typically held close to the side of the body. The spine maintains an upright position, with only negligible adjustments for balance. The action completes as the right arm reverses the motion, extending back to rest the hand at the side.
In the "Flicking hair" action sequence, the individual initiates the motion by lifting their arms, primarily through flexion at the elbow and shoulder joints, bringing their hands up near the head. The wrist joints slightly flex as the hands reach the level of the head. This is followed by a rapid extension of the elbows, pushing the hands outward and backward in a swift, whip-like motion, fully engaging the shoulder joints in an arc. Concurrently, the neck extends slightly as the head tilts back. The action concludes as the arms are lowered back down to the sides to rest, primarily through elbow and shoulder flexion.
In the "Thumbs up" action sequence, the primary movement involves the arm and hand, specifically initiating with the shoulder joint elevating slightly as the elbow joint extends to raise the forearm. Subsequently, the wrist joint stabilizes while the thumb's metacarpophalangeal joint extends, separating from the fingers which flex at their respective metacarpophalangeal joints into a semi-closed fist. The thumb then remains elevated and distinctively visible for a brief duration as the entire arm maintains a steady posture, before the forearm flexes back towards the torso as the action concludes, the thumb returning to align with the fingers.
In the "Thumbs down" action sequence, the individual begins with both arms neutrally at their sides. They first elevate the right arm, bending it at the elbow to bring the right hand into the frontal plane close to the chest. The right wrist is then flexed, pointing the thumb downward while other fingers curl slightly inward to stabilize the gesture. Meanwhile, the left arm remains stationary by the side. This motion is generally maintained briefly before the right arm smoothly descends back to the initial neutral side position, marking the end of the action sequence.
In the sequence "Making OK sign," the person begins with both arms relaxed at their sides. Firstly, the shoulder joint of one arm elevates slightly as the elbow flexes, bringing the forearm to a vertical position. Simultaneously, the wrist starts to supinate, turning the palm to face forward. As the wrist completes its motion, the thumb and the index finger of the same hand curl towards each other. The thumb abducts while the index finger slightly flexes and abducts, leading both digits to meet, forming the "OK" circle, while the remaining fingers remain flexed towards the palm. This configuration is held briefly before the joints gradually return to the starting relaxed state.
In the "Making victory sign" action sequence, the predominant skeletal motion involves the arms and hands. Initially, both arms are neutrally positioned alongside the body. Gradually, one arm (typically the right) elevates at the shoulder joint, flexing at the elbow to bring the forearm upwards to a vertical position, with the hand near head level. The wrist joint remains stable while the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints extend. Crucially, the index and middle fingers separate to distinctly form a 'V', while the other fingers curl inward slightly. This configuration is maintained momentarily before the arm returns to the original neutral position by the side.
In the action sequence of "Stapling book," the human begins with both arms extended forward, shoulder joints slightly raised. The dominant arm's elbow then flexes bringing the forearm and hand downward while the other arm remains relatively stable, serving as a support. Mid-sequence, there is a notable rotation and downward thrust in the wrist and forearm of the dominant arm, indicating the engagement of the stapler. Subsequently, the elbow of the non-dominant arm flexes slightly to adjust the position. As the action concludes, both arms return to a neutral position with elbows extended and forearms oriented horizontally, moving back to the initial posture.
In the "Counting money" action sequence, the skeletal motion primarily involves the upper limbs. The elbow of the dominant arm maintains a slight bend while the hand executes fine motor manipulations. The opposite arm, less dynamic, often provides stabilizing support by being either held stationary or making minimal adjustments to maintain balance and coordination. Simultaneously, the shoulder joints occasionally rotate slightly for adjustments, ensuring smooth continuous movement of the arms. The wrists articulate minutely yet frequently, pivoting mostly in flexion and extension, matching the precise tasks performed by the fingers. There is little to no significant movement in the lower limbs, spine, or hips.
In the "Cutting nails" action sequence, the dominant arm predominately leads the motion. The shoulder joint initiates by extending slightly forward, while the elbow flexes to bring the hand close to the other hand’s fingers. The wrist of the dominant hand then enacts minor flexing and rotating movements for precision. Correspondingly, the non-dominant arm remains relatively stationary, mainly involving slight flexion at the elbow to stabilize and present the fingers. Throughout the sequence, the rest of the body, including legs and torso, maintains a steady posture, emphasizing the action's focus on fine motor skills in the upper limbs.
In the "Cutting paper (using scissors)" action sequence, the dominant arm primarily exhibits a cyclical motion pattern. The shoulder joint remains relatively stable, providing a foundation as the elbow joint alternates between flexion and extension, smoothly driving the forearm in a repetitive open-close pattern. This is synchronized with subtle rotations and slight flexion-extension movements at the wrist joint to accommodate the action precision. The opposite arm typically manifests subtle movements, mainly stabilizing by slight adjustments at the shoulder and elbow joints to support the paper. This sequence is rhythmic, with a consistent pace maintained throughout the action’s duration.
In the action sequence of snapping fingers, the primary movement is observed in the arm and hand joints. Initially, both the elbow and wrist remain relatively stationary as the fingers configure into position. The middle finger and thumb of one hand predominantly engage, moving to contact each other with the middle finger sliding swiftly down the thumb. This action is typically preceded by a subtle preparatory positioning where the middle finger is raised slightly above the thumb. Simultaneously, the other fingers curl slightly toward the palm but do not significantly contribute to the snapping motion. This finger action is swift, resulting in a rapid motion sequence that resets promptly to the starting position after the snap.
In the "Opening bottle" sequence, the initial posture generally shows the figure’s upper limbs positioned at rest before one arm elevates, reflecting movement at the shoulder joint. Meanwhile, the elbow flexes, bringing the hand towards the upper body. The opposite arm might slightly adjust for stability but remains relatively stationary. Upon reaching the peak of the movement, the wrist joints articulate, performing rotations essential for grasping and manipulating, simulating the action of opening a lid. After the peak of activity, the arm gradually returns to a resting position by extending the elbow and lowering the shoulder, marking the completion of the action sequence.
In the "Sniffing" action sequence, the primary skeletal movements involve the head and neck joints. Initially, the head tilts slightly downward, and the neck flexes as the shoulders subtly elevate, possibly indicating an inhalation phase. Concurrently, there's minimal engagement of the arm joints, suggesting they remain relatively static, possibly held loosely beside the body. During the sequence, the head might perform slight nods or rotate with a minimal lateral sway, stressing the focus of movement toward the olfactory stimulus. The trunk maintains an upright posture, indicating stability and anchoring the motion predominantly in the upper body. The action concludes as the head returns to a neutral, forward-facing position.
In the "Squatting down" sequence, the action initiates with the hip joint flexing while the knees and ankles also flex simultaneously. The hips move backwards and downwards, guiding the torso to lean slightly forward to maintain balance. As this occurs, the angle at the knee joints increases as they project over the feet, and the ankles adjust to stabilize the position. Throughout this movement, the feet remain flat on the ground. The range of motion is most evident in the hip and knee joints which bear the brunt of the movement, with the ankles providing necessary adjustments for balance until the lowest position of the squat is reached.
In the "Tossing a coin" action sequence, the skeletal motion initiates with the shoulder of the dominant arm elevating slightly while the elbow flexes, bringing the forearm upward toward the horizontal plane. The wrist engages in slight flexion holding the position briefly. Subsequently, the forearm rotates at the elbow, moving from a near-horizontal position to a more vertical orientation as the hand opens in extension. The shoulder joint then facilitates a swift downward flick with a combined motion of elbow extension and a rapid downward snap from the wrist, completing the toss. Throughout the sequence, the non-dominant arm remains relatively static, with minimal displacement.
In the "Folding paper" action sequence, the primary movement involves the shoulder joints, which initially flex to bring the elbows and forearms into a horizontal position in front of the torso. The elbows exhibit repeated flexion and extension as the hands repetitively converge and diverge directly in front of the body, syncing with simultaneous wrist flexions to manipulate hypothetical planes. This coordinated action progresses rhythmically, with intermittent brief stabilizations where the elbows and wrists momentarily cease motion, suggesting precision adjustments. Throughout this sequence, the upper body remains mostly static apart from slight torso adjustments to facilitate reach and support upper limb movement.
In the action sequence "Balling up paper," the primary skeletal motion begins with the shoulders in a neutral position, quickly followed by the flexion of both elbows, drawing the forearm upwards towards the chest. Simultaneously, the wrists are flexed, and the fingers converge toward the palms, contracting into a semi-closed position. As the action progresses, the hands execute minor, repetitive twisting and squeezing movements, indicative of compression. Throughout the sequence, shoulder rotation is minimal, maintaining a stable base for the focused activity carried out by the arms and hands. The action concludes as the elbows extend slightly, and then return to a relaxed state alongside the body.
In the "Playing with a magic cube" sequence, the individual primarily engages their upper limbs. The shoulders exhibit rotational movements, with occasional elevation and depression as the elbows flex and extend rhythmically. Both wrists articulate with gentle twists and turns, adjusting the orientation and angle of the hands. The sequence involves repetitive bending and extending of the fingers, suggesting precise manipulation and grip adjustments. Throughout the action, there is minimal involvement of lower limbs, with slight shifts in weight possibly indicating subtle repositioning of the torso for comfort or optimal arm movement. These movements are cyclic, reflecting the repetitive nature of the task.
In the "Applying cream on face" action sequence, the human skeleton exhibits distinctive movements predominantly involving the arms. Initially, the elbows flex to bring the hands close to the face. The shoulder joints rotate and adjust as the hands move in small circular paths around the face, applying cream to various zones such as the cheeks, forehead, and chin. This motion requires synchronized coordination between the wrists, which rotate minutely to allow thorough application, and the elbows, which slightly extend or flex as needed to efficiently reach different facial areas. Throughout the sequence, the upper body remains mostly stable with minor adjustments to enhance reach and precision.
In the video sequence depicting "Applying cream on hand back," the action initiates with the shoulder joints slightly elevated, orienting the arms towards each other in front of the torso. The elbows are bent approximately at right angles, facilitating the forearm and hands to be oriented towards each other and slightly upward. The wrists show flexion where each hand’s palm faces the opposing dorsal hand back. The primary motion involves the articulation of the wrists, as one hand, while maintaining a steady position supported by elbow and shoulder stability, overlays its palm onto the back of the other hand in a repeated, gentle swiping motion. Over time, the swiping action gradually covers different areas of the hand back through slight adjustments at the shoulder and elbow joints of both arms, ensuring the cream is spread uniformly.
In the sequence of "Putting on a bag," the action initiates with the shoulder joints elevating and rotating, guiding the corresponding arm movements. The elbow joints flex, positioning the hands behind the torso to grasp an imaginary point where a bag's straps would typically be located. Concurrently, there is a slight torso bend and rotation to facilitate arm reach and torso alignment, ensuring balance and reach optimization. As the arms lift, reflecting the bag's ascending motion, the wrists articulate to adjust the angle of the grip. The action concludes as the elbows extend slightly, settling the arms and shoulders into a natural, less elevated posture, suggesting the bag is now securely in place.
In the sequence labeled "Taking off a bag," the skeletal motion begins with the shoulder joints elevating and retracting, accompanied by a slight forward flexion at the elbow joints to facilitate grip. Concurrently, the wrist joints rotate to adjust the angle of the arms. As the action progresses, one shoulder joint prominently abducts and externally rotates, leading the corresponding arm in an arced motion to maneuver the bag over the head. The opposite arm assists by mirroring a similar, but less pronounced, movement pattern. Subsequently, both arms extend and downwardly rotate at the shoulders, completing the bag removal with a controlled release.
In the action sequence of "Putting something into a bag," the human subject first flexes the elbow and shoulder joints to lift one arm upwards and forward, grasping with similar motion in the wrist and finger joints. Concurrently, the torso subtly bends forward at the hip joints, stabilizing with slight knee flexion. After the initial object retrieval, the arm that completes the grasping then retracts slightly before extending forward and downward into the bag's opening, characterized mainly by shoulder and elbow extension. This motion may repeat several times depending on the number of objects being placed into the bag, concluding as the back straightens and arms lower to a resting position.
In the action sequence "Taking something out of a bag," the human starts by stabilizing their stance with slight knee flexion. Simultaneously, the shoulder joint on one arm initiates a downward and backward movement while the elbow flexes and the hand reaches towards the opening of the bag. As the shoulder stabilizes in a slightly abducted position, the elbow joint adjusts to varying degrees of flexion consistent with searching and grasping. Once the item is secured, the elbow extends, lifting the hand out of the bag, and the shoulder returns to a neutral position, completing the retrieval sequence. Throughout this action, the opposite arm may slightly adjust for balance.
In the action sequence "Opening a box," the human skeleton initiates movement by bending the elbows to bring the hands together in front of the torso. Concurrently, there is a slight rotation of the shoulder joints, facilitating the forward and downward movement of the arms. As the hands approach the waist level, the fingers flex to grip. Throughout this sequence, the spine remains relatively upright, exhibiting minimal bending or twisting. The knees flex slightly to lower the body as the arms reach down, providing stability and balance, before returning to a standing posture as the arms lift slightly in a smooth, coordinated manner.
In the "Moving heavy objects" action sequence, the human skeletal motion commences with the knees bending and hips lowering as the arms reach forward, exhibiting flexion at the elbow and shoulder joints. Throughout the sequence, the spine maintains a slight flexion to support upper body stability. As the object is lifted, the knees and hips extend, pushing the torso upright; concurrently, the shoulders exhibit a range of motion from extension to adduction as the arms stabilize the load by aligning more directly under it. Finally, the sequence culminates as the legs alternate between stepping and stabilizing to facilitate forward movement, exhibiting a combination of hip and knee flexion and extension.
In the skeletal motion pattern of the action sequence labeled "Shaking fist," the primary movement involves the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints of one arm. Initially, the shoulder joint is moderately abducted, while the elbow is flexed, positioning the forearm perpendicular to the upper arm. The wrist is initially held in a neutral position. The action commences with rhythmic, horizontal shaking of the clenched fist, facilitated by alternating pronation and supination of the wrist, coupled with slight flexion and extension movements at the elbow to add dynamism. Simultaneously, the shoulder joint exhibits stable, minimal oscillatory movements to support the primary action carried out by the lower arm. This sequence repeats multiple times with a consistent tempo.
In the action sequence of "Throwing up a cap/hat," the motion begins with the person's upper limb, particularly the shoulder and elbow of the dominant arm, elevating and slightly retracting. As the elbow extends, the hand moves upwards rapidly, leading the action. The shoulder joint experiences a combination of abduction and slight external rotation, facilitating this upward gesture. Simultaneously, there is a subtle counterbalance involving the non-dominant arm, which slightly abducts and flexes at the elbow to maintain stability. Throughout this motion, the torso remains relatively stable, with minor adjustments in posture to support the arm's dynamic movement. The culmination sees the elbow reaching full extension as the hand reaches its highest point briefly before reversing direction following the force exerted.
In the action sequence labeled "Raising hands up," the individual begins with arms hanging loosely at their sides. Initiation of the motion involves the abduction and upward flexion of the shoulder joints, concurrently raising both arms outward and upward. Meanwhile, the elbow joints extend, ensuring the arms straighten as they elevate. The wrists remain relatively neutral, following the line of the forearms. This upward movement continues until the hands are approximately at or slightly above the level of the head. Throughout the sequence, the spine maintains an erect posture, and the hip, knee, and ankle joints remain stable, supporting an upright stance due to minimal lower body movement.
In the "Crossing arms" sequence, the individual initiates movement by lifting both arms laterally at the shoulder joints, with slight flexion at the elbow joints to accommodate the upcoming cross. As the arms elevate to chest height, the forearms horizontally rotate inwards, causing the wrists to cross over the anterior chest area. Concurrently, the elbow joints achieve a more pronounced flexion, finally resting in a crossed configuration across the chest. This position involves the stabilization of both shoulder and elbow joints in a semi-flexed state. As the action concludes, the individual reversibly rotates the forearms outward and lowers the arms, returning to an initial relaxed stance.
In the action sequence of making arm circles, the shoulder joints act as the pivotal axis, with each shoulder engaging in a rotational movement. The elbows are kept relatively extended, resulting in wide circles being traced by the hands. The movement progresses methodically through the sequence starting with small circles that progressively become larger. This circular motion is typically performed first in a forward direction and then reversed, engaging the upper arm and forearm throughout. The wrists maintain slight flexion to ensure a smooth continuation of the circular path, while the rest of the body remains primarily stationary, focusing the activity on the arm joints.
In the "Swinging arms" sequence, the primary movement involves the shoulder joints, which act as pivotal points for the rhythmic oscillation of the arms. Initially, the elbows slightly bend while the forearms and hands project outwards and upwards in an alternate pattern. As one arm swings forward, reaching roughly shoulder height, the opposite arm moves backward, aligning near the torso. This action creates a continuous pendulum-like motion in the sagittal plane. The wrists remain relatively stable with minimal flexing, while the hip joints provide subtle counterbalancing adjustments, facilitating upper body equilibrium throughout the repetitive forward and backward arm swinging.
In the "Running on the spot" action, the human skeleton exhibits a repetitive and rhythmic motion primarily centered around the legs and arms. The hip joints show a cyclical lifting and lowering, driving the corresponding upward and downward movements of the knees, which alternately bend and extend in a pronounced manner. The ankles flex to assist in the slight lifting of the feet, which remain under the hip line. Concurrently, the shoulders remain relatively stable while the elbows flex and extend in coordination with the opposing leg movements, maintaining a balanced alternation between the limbs, promoting a constant, dynamic, and stationary running motion.
In the "Butt kicks (kick backward)" action, the individual primarily engages their lower body joints. The action starts with the knees bending alternately, driving the heels to approach the buttocks. Each knee demonstrates a cyclic flexion and extension pattern, occurring in a rapid, repetitive rhythm. Hips maintain slight flexion throughout, stabilizing the torso, while the ankles flex to allow the heels to kick backward closer to the buttocks. The upper body remains relatively steady, with the shoulders and elbows experiencing minimal movement, mainly to aid balance. This sequence progresses quickly with alternating leg movements, exhibiting a consistent rhythm throughout the action.
In the "Cross toe touch" sequence, the individual begins in a standing position. As the action commences, they lift their left leg, bending at the hip and knee joints, while simultaneously swinging their right arm across the body towards the elevated left knee, articulating prominently at the shoulder and elbow joints. The right knee remains slightly bent for balance. This movement involves a cross-lateral coordination between the right arm and left leg. After a brief touch, the limbs return to their initial positions. The sequence may be repeated with alternate limbs to maintain rhythmic and symmetric motion patterns.
In the "Side Kick" action sequence, the human skeletal movement begins with the supporting leg slightly bending at the knee to stabilize the body, while the pelvis tilts sideways, aligning with the directional plane of the kick. Simultaneously, the kicking leg lifts at the hip joint outward and extends at the knee to execute a linear side kick. The hip of the kicking leg reaches maximum abduction followed by a sharp extension, and then flexion brings the leg back down, with the foot returning to the initial position. The arms typically remain bent at the elbows, held up near the chest to maintain balance.
In the video sequence labeled "Yawning," the human skeleton demonstrates a distinct pattern starting with the shoulders rising and the elbows moving laterally from the body. Concurrently, the wrists flex, drawing the hands toward the head, typically aligning with the ears or slightly above. As the action progresses, the spine extends slightly, indicating a stretch through the torso. Following the peak of the shoulder and elbow displacement, these joints gradually return to a neutral, resting position. Throughout the sequence, the hip and knee joints remain relatively stable, indicating that the action primarily involves the upper body.
In the "Stretching oneself" sequence, the human subject begins with an upright stance. The core motion involves elevating both arms overhead, leading to significant shoulder flexion. Concurrently, the elbows remain extended as the arms reach upward and slightly outward, aligning the hands above the head. Simultaneously, the spine extends, and the pelvis may tilt anteriorly slightly, enhancing the stretch. Following peak extension, the arms are lowered back down in a controlled manner to the initial position by reversing the shoulder movement while the spine and pelvis return to a neutral stance, completing the stretch cycle.
In the "Blowing nose" sequence, the individual primarily employs the upper body joints, especially the elbows, shoulders, and wrists. Initially, both arms are elevated as the elbows bend, bringing the hands (guided by wrist movement) toward the face. The shoulders experience slight anterior and upward rotation to position the hands correctly in front of the nose. During this action, the wrists adjust to optimize the angle for hand placement, predominantly near the central facial area. This posture is typically maintained momentarily before the arms retract, straightening the elbows and lowering the hands as the shoulders return to a neutral position.
In the "Hitting other person with something" sequence, the primary actor initiates the action with significant rotation and extension of the shoulder joint of the dominant arm, which draws back slightly as the elbow extends outward and slightly upward. Concurrently, the wrist remains rigid to stabilize the action. The torso of the actor rotates towards the target, enhancing the force generated by the shoulder and arm movement. The hips shift laterally to support this rotation, with a slight bending of the knees for stability. The non-dominant arm often moves in opposition to balance the body, manifesting minor flexion at the elbow and shoulder. This sequence culminates as the dominant arm swings forward, driven by a powerful extension of the shoulder and elbow joints, directing force outward in a swift, linear trajectory.
In the "Wielding knife towards other person" sequence, the skeletal motion begins with the shoulder of the dominant arm abducting, while the elbow flexes bringing the forearm upwards and slightly forward. The wrist undergoes slight extension. Sequentially, as the shoulder continues to abduct, the whole arm swiftly extends forward directly towards the other individual. The non-dominant arm typically shows a defensive or stabilizing adjustment, slightly abducting and bending at the elbow. The spine remains fairly erect, with minor torsion toward the target person and the hips and knees maintain stability with minimal movement, anchoring the body for upper limb motion.
In the action sequence identified as "Knocking over other person (hit with body)," the attacker initiates movement by shifting weight onto one leg, leading to a notable rotation at the hip joint, which positions the torso for forward momentum. Concurrently, the shoulder joints retract slightly, pulling the arms back. As the attacker gains speed, the knee joints aggressively extend, particularly on the advancing leg, propelling the body forward. The elbows remain bent, stabilizing the arms' position close to the body, ready to aid in balancing or further impact. Upon collision, the hip and shoulder joints on the side of the impacted person experience sudden backward displacement, indicating the absorption of force.
In the "Grabbing other person's stuff" action, the sequence commences with the shoulder joint angling forward, pulling the elbow and subsequently the wrist in a trespassing path towards the object. As the initiator's torso slightly rotates towards the target, there's a pronounced extension in the arm of interest, particularly the elbow and wrist joints. Concurrently, the other arm adjusts, often bending at the elbow to stabilize or support the torso's shift. Depending on position, the legs may show minimal to no significant displacement except for slight bending at the knees to maintain balance. The entire motion is swift, generally culminating as the wrist joint retracts towards the body with the grabbed item.
In the "Shooting at other person with a gun" sequence, the human skeleton predominantly exhibits upper body activity. Initially, the shoulders orient forward with the elbow of the arm wielding the gun flexing, aligning the forearm and gun parallel to the line of sight. The opposite arm either stays static or aids in stabilizing the gun, exhibiting minimal flexion at the elbow. The wrist of the shooting hand remains firm throughout. Simultaneously, the spine sustains an erect posture, with slight torsion if adjusting aim. Lower body joints, including hips and knees, show minimal movement, generally maintaining a steady, balanced stance with feet shoulder-width apart.
In the "Stepping on foot" human action sequence, the action begins with the thigh of the aggressor's active leg lifting, causing the knee to bend while the hip flexes, elevating the foot off the ground. Concurrently, the inactive leg supports the body, maintaining a slight bend at the knee for balance. As the active foot ascends, it then moves forward slightly and descends, targeting the foot of the recipient. The contact involves the aggressor’s foot pressing downward while their ankle extends. Following impact, the aggressor's leg retracts, bending at the knee and hip to resume a neutral standing position alongside the inactive leg.
In the "High-five" action sequence, two individuals initially position their arms at their sides. As the sequence begins, both raise one arm each—typically the right—simultaneously. This motion is characterized by flexion at the shoulder and elbow joints, lifting the forearms and rotating the shoulders so that the palms face each other. The hands of both participants elevate to approximately head height. At the peak of the motion, the palms of both individuals meet in mid-air between them, engaging primarily the wrist joints. Following this brief contact, both retract their arms by extending at the elbows and lowering via shoulder adduction, returning their arms to the initial positions beside their bodies.
In the "Cheers and drink" sequence, the human skeletal motion begins with both upper limbs raised simultaneously, elbows bent, directing the hands' approach toward each other, typically in front of the chest. Following the brief interaction of the hands, there is a pronounced backward movement of the elbows, resulting in a tilt of the forearms and an upward lift of the hands towards the head. The shoulders exhibit limited movement, mainly stabilizing the arms. The action culminates as the forearms and hands descend towards the initial resting position, completing the sequence. Throughout the action, the head maintains a steady posture, and there is minimal articulation from the lower limbs.
In the action sequence labeled "Carrying something with other person," two individuals synchronize their skeletal movements. Initially, both exhibit bilateral shoulder abduction combined with elbow flexion to presumably hoist an unseen shared load. As they progress forward, there is alternating hip flexion and extension, paired with reciprocal knee flexion and extension, typical of walking. The shoulder joints remain relatively static in slight abduction to maintain load stability, while the wrists face minimal rotations to keep a steady grip. Throughout the sequence, spinal alignment adjusts slightly to distribute weight, ensuring both parties share the burden evenly until the walking sequence concludes.
In the action sequence labeled "Taking a photo of other person," the human starts with a neutral stance, feet shoulder-width apart. The primary movements involve the upper body, particularly the arms and hands. One arm (typically the dominant) is raised parallel to the ground, bending at the elbow to hold an imaginary camera up in front of the face. The shoulder and elbow joints of this arm stabilize in this position during the sequence, while the other arm may assist in supporting the position of the first arm or hang naturally by the side. The wrists maintain a steady orientation to mimic holding and operating a camera. There is minimal movement in the lower body, with slight adjustments in the feet and knees for balance, maintaining overall steadiness. As the action progresses, the upper body may lean slightly forward or backward to adjust the angle or steadiness of the "camera."
In the human action sequence labeled "Following other person," the primary skeletal motion involves the lower body, particularly at the hip, knee, and ankle joints, facilitating a walking pattern. Initially, the torso remains oriented towards another individual, with minor adjustments in the cervical spine (neck) to keep the following subject in view. The elbows slightly flex adjusting to balance, while the shoulders mildly rotate. As the sequence progresses, consecutive alternating steps are evident with rhythmic flexion and extension of the knees, accompanied by a regular propelling motion from the ankles. The hip joints exhibit a forward and upward movement pattern coordinating the legs for consistent pacing, while maintaining a stable upper body posture.
In the skeletal sequence of "Whispering in other person’s ear," one individual initiates the action by slightly tilting their head towards the listener while maintaining a vertical torso. Concurrently, there's a gentle rotation of the neck and the slight elevation of the shoulder closer to the listener. The initiating individual's elbow flexes bringing the corresponding forearm upwards and forwards, subtly positioning the hand near their own chest. The listener reacts by subtly angling their head to accommodate and better hear the speaker. Their shoulders remain relatively static, providing a stable frame as they slightly lean their torso towards the initiator, closing the gap between them to facilitate the whisper.
In the action sequence labeled "Exchanging things with another person," the skeletal motion begins with both participants standing upright facing each other. The initiator extends an arm forward, primarily at the shoulder joint, while the elbow joint remains moderately flexed to maintain a forward projection of the hand. Simultaneously, the receiver mirrors this motion, extending their arm towards the initiator. At the midpoint of the sequence, both individuals’ wrists and fingers show increased activity, suggesting the handover. Following this, each person retracts their arm by flexing at the elbow and slightly rotating the shoulder inward, returning to a neutral, relaxed stance.
In the human action sequence labeled "Supporting somebody with hand," the shoulder joint of the supporting arm initially exhibits a downward and outward movement as the elbow joint flexes, bringing the hand in a lower, forward position, extending towards the other individual. Concurrently, the wrist stabilizes, allowing for a firm yet gentle support. As the action progresses, there is a mild upward shift in the shoulder joint, indicating a slight lifting or stabilizing motion. The opposite arm remains relatively static, with minor adjustments in shoulder positioning for balance. The hip and knee joints on both legs adjust subtly to maintain balance and support throughout the sequence.
In the "Finger-guessing game (playing rock-paper-scissors)" sequence, the skeletal motion predominantly involves rotations and extensions of the arm and hand joints. Initially, both upper limbs are alternately elevated to about chest height with minimal elbow flexion. The wrists engage in cyclic motions, alternating between slight flexion and extension in synchronization with each game count. At the decisive moment, the wrists are held steady, and the fingers configure into one of the three symbolic shapes: a closed fist, an open hand, or a partially closed fist with the index and middle fingers extended. This configuration concludes the sequence, followed by a return to a resting position.
